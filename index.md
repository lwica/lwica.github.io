# LWICA

An up-to-date DTN implementation.

## Goal of the project

There's few DTN implementations but most of the are outdated.
This implementation aims to follow the last updates of the standards/drafts.

### Standardisation sub-project

Some DTN implementations aren't compatible with other ones because of usage of not well-defined data syntaxes.
This may be caused by foggy or missing definitions.

In our implementation, every occurence of not well-defined data interchange will be first documented in our wikis,
then a notification and the proposal will be submitted to the standard/draft maintainers.
